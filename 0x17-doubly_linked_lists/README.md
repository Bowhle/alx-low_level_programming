# Doubly Linked List Project

## Description
This project implements various operations on a doubly linked list in C, including insertion, deletion, and traversal of nodes. The code follows the Betty coding style and includes functions for adding nodes at different positions in the list.

## Functions
- `insert_dnodeint_at_index`: Inserts a new node at a specific position in the doubly linked list.
- `add_dnodeint`: Adds a new node at the beginning of the list.
- `add_dnodeint_end`: Adds a new node at the end of the list.

## Requirements
- All code is written in C and follows the Betty style guide.
- Compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `gcc`.
- Tested with `gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`.

## Usage
To compile the code:
```bash
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c -o dlist
